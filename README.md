Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
Convert categorical features to numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Normalize or standardize numerical features.

Feature Engineering:
Create new features based on existing ones (e.g., extract titles from names).

Model Selection and Training:
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines).
Train models on the cleaned and preprocessed data.

Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy.
